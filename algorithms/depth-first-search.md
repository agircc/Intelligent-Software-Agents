# Depth-First Search (DFS) in Intelligent Software Agents

## 1. Example: Exploring a Maze

Imagine an agent navigating a maze from a start point to a goal. The agent must find a path, avoiding obstacles. Depth-First Search (DFS) is suitable for this task because it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, which can be efficient for certain maze configurations.

## 2. Applications of Depth-First Search

- **Maze Solving**: Finding paths in mazes and puzzles.
- **Topological Sorting**: Ordering tasks or dependencies.
- **Cycle Detection**: Identifying cycles in graphs.
- **Game Playing**: Exploring game states in depth.
- **Web Crawling**: Deep exploration of web pages.

## 3. Detailed Introduction

### 3.1 What is Depth-First Search?

DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack (or recursion) to manage the order of exploration, ensuring that nodes are processed in a depth-first manner.

### 3.2 How DFS Works

1. Start at the root node (or any node).
2. Explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
3. Use a stack or recursion to manage the nodes to be explored.

### 3.3 Python Example

```python
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    for neighbor in graph[start] - visited:
        dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
    return visited
```

### 3.4 When to Use DFS

- When the goal is to explore a graph deeply.
- For topological sorting and cycle detection.
- When memory usage is a concern (DFS can be more memory-efficient than BFS for deep graphs).

### 3.5 Limitations

- Does not guarantee the shortest path (unlike BFS).
- Can get stuck in deep paths if the goal is not found.
