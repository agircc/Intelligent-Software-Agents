# Greedy Best-First Search in Intelligent Software Agents

## 1. Example: Finding a Path in a Maze

Imagine an agent navigating a maze from a start point to a goal. The agent must find a path, avoiding obstacles. Greedy Best-First Search is suitable for this task because it uses a heuristic to guide the search, prioritizing nodes that appear closest to the goal.

## 2. Applications of Greedy Best-First Search

- **Pathfinding in Robotics and Games**: Finding paths in grid-based environments.
- **Network Routing**: Optimizing routes in communication networks.
- **Puzzle Solving**: Solving puzzles like the 8-puzzle or Rubik's Cube.
- **Resource Allocation**: Assigning resources to tasks under constraints.
- **Game Playing**: Move selection in games with heuristic guidance.

## 3. Detailed Introduction

### 3.1 What is Greedy Best-First Search?

Greedy Best-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide the search. It expands the node that appears closest to the goal based on the heuristic, without considering the cost of the path taken so far.

### 3.2 How Greedy Best-First Search Works

1. Start at the root node (or any node).
2. Use a priority queue to explore nodes in order of heuristic value.
3. Expand the node with the lowest heuristic value.
4. Repeat until the goal is reached or all nodes are explored.

### 3.3 Python Example

```python
import heapq

def greedy_best_first_search(graph, start, goal, heuristic):
    queue = [(heuristic(start), start, [])]
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        (h, node, path) = heapq.heappop(queue)
        if node == goal:
            return path + [node]
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(queue, (heuristic(neighbor), neighbor, path + [node]))
    return None
```

### 3.4 When to Use Greedy Best-First Search

- When a heuristic function is available to guide the search.
- For problems where the goal is to find a path quickly, even if it's not the shortest.

### 3.5 Limitations

- Does not guarantee the shortest path (unlike UCS or A*).
- Performance heavily depends on the quality of the heuristic.
