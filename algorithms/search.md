# Search Algorithms in Intelligent Software Agents

## 1. Example: Solving the 8-Puzzle

Consider an agent tasked with solving the 8-puzzle, where tiles must be moved to reach a goal configuration. The agent must search through possible moves to find a solution. Search algorithms like Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and A* Search are used to systematically explore possible states.

## 2. Applications of Search Algorithms

- **Automated Planning**: Generating action sequences to achieve goals.
- **Game Playing**: Move selection in chess, Go, and other games.
- **Robotics**: Path and task planning.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Parsing and translation.
- **Optimization**: Solving combinatorial and constraint satisfaction problems.

## 3. Detailed Introduction

### 3.1 What are Search Algorithms?

Search algorithms explore a problem space to find solutions, paths, or optimal configurations. They are fundamental in AI for problem-solving, planning, and reasoning.

### 3.2 Types of Search Algorithms

#### Uninformed (Blind) Search
- No domain-specific knowledge; only uses problem definition.
- Examples: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search.

#### Informed (Heuristic) Search
- Uses domain knowledge to guide the search.
- Examples: Greedy Best-First Search, A* Search.

### 3.3 Core Algorithms

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explores all nodes at one depth before moving deeper.
- Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs.

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- Useful for exhaustive search and topological sorting.

#### Uniform Cost Search
- Expands the least-cost node first; optimal for uniform costs.

#### Greedy Best-First Search
- Expands the node that appears closest to the goal based on a heuristic.

#### A* Search
- Combines path cost and heuristic to find optimal paths efficiently.

### 3.4 Python Example: A* Search

```python
import heapq

def astar_search(start, goal, neighbors_fn, heuristic_fn):
    queue = [(heuristic_fn(start), 0, start, [])]
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        (est_total, cost, node, path) = heapq.heappop(queue)
        if node == goal:
            return path + [node]
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor, step_cost in neighbors_fn(node):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(queue, (
                    cost + step_cost + heuristic_fn(neighbor),
                    cost + step_cost,
                    neighbor,
                    path + [node]
                ))
    return None
```

### 3.5 When to Use Search Algorithms
- When the solution requires exploring a large or complex state space.
- For planning, scheduling, and optimization tasks.

### 3.6 Limitations
- State space explosion for large problems.
- Heuristic quality greatly affects performance for informed search.
