# Constraint Satisfaction in Intelligent Software Agents

## 1. Example: Sudoku Solver

Consider an agent solving a Sudoku puzzle. Each cell must be filled with a digit such that no digit repeats in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid. The agent must assign values to variables (cells) while satisfying all constraints. CSP algorithms like backtracking and arc consistency are used to efficiently find solutions.

## 2. Applications of Constraint Satisfaction

- **Scheduling**: Assigning time slots to tasks or resources.
- **Resource Allocation**: Assigning resources to tasks under constraints.
- **Puzzle Solving**: Sudoku, crosswords, and logic puzzles.
- **Configuration**: Product and system configuration.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Parsing and semantic analysis.

## 3. Detailed Introduction

### 3.1 What is a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)?

A CSP consists of:
- **Variables**: Elements to be assigned values.
- **Domains**: Possible values for each variable.
- **Constraints**: Restrictions on allowable combinations of values.

The goal is to assign values to all variables such that all constraints are satisfied.

### 3.2 Core CSP Algorithms

#### Backtracking Search
- Systematically assigns values to variables, backtracking when a constraint is violated.

**Python Example:**
```python
def backtracking(assignment, variables, domains, constraints):
    if len(assignment) == len(variables):
        return assignment
    var = select_unassigned_variable(variables, assignment)
    for value in domains[var]:
        if is_consistent(var, value, assignment, constraints):
            assignment[var] = value
            result = backtracking(assignment, variables, domains, constraints)
            if result:
                return result
            del assignment[var]
    return None
```

#### Forward Checking
- After assigning a variable, eliminates inconsistent values from domains of unassigned variables.

#### Arc Consistency (AC-3)
- Ensures that for every value of one variable, there is a consistent value in connected variables.

**Python Example:**
```python
from collections import deque

def ac3(variables, domains, constraints):
    queue = deque([(xi, xj) for xi in variables for xj in variables if xi != xj])
    while queue:
        xi, xj = queue.popleft()
        if revise(domains, xi, xj, constraints):
            if not domains[xi]:
                return False
            for xk in variables:
                if xk != xi and xk != xj:
                    queue.append((xk, xi))
    return True

def revise(domains, xi, xj, constraints):
    revised = False
    for x in set(domains[xi]):
        if not any(is_consistent(xi, x, xj, y, constraints) for y in domains[xj]):
            domains[xi].remove(x)
            revised = True
    return revised
```

### 3.3 When to Use CSP Algorithms
- When the problem can be formulated as variables, domains, and constraints.
- For scheduling, allocation, and combinatorial puzzles.

### 3.4 Limitations
- Exponential complexity in the worst case.
- Requires careful constraint modeling for efficiency.
