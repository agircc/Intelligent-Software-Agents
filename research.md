## Theoretical Foundations

### 1. Intelligent Agents

Intelligent agents are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. The key characteristics of intelligent agents include:

- **Autonomy**: Operating without direct human intervention
- **Reactivity**: Responding to environmental changes
- **Proactivity**: Taking initiative to achieve goals
- **Social Ability**: Interacting with other agents
- **Learning**: Improving performance through experience

### 2. Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems (MAS) consist of multiple interacting intelligent agents. Key concepts include:

- **Coordination**: Managing agent interactions
- **Negotiation**: Resolving conflicts and reaching agreements
- **Cooperation**: Working together to achieve common goals
- **Competition**: Competing for limited resources
- **Emergence**: Complex behaviors arising from simple interactions

### 3. Learning and Adaptation

Agents can learn and adapt through various mechanisms:

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning from rewards and penalties
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled examples
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning patterns from unlabeled data
- **Transfer Learning**: Applying knowledge to new situations
- **Meta-Learning**: Learning how to learn
