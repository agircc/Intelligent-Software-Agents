# Monte Carlo Methods in Reinforcement Learning

## 1. Introduction

Monte Carlo (MC) methods are a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that learn from complete episodes of experience. Unlike temporal difference (TD) methods, which update estimates based on bootstrapping, MC methods wait until the end of an episode to update value estimates using the actual returns.

### 1.1 Core Concepts

- **Episode**: A complete sequence of states, actions, and rewards from start to terminal state
- **Return**: The sum of discounted rewards from a state to the end of an episode
- **First-Visit MC**: Updates value estimates only on the first visit to a state in an episode
- **Every-Visit MC**: Updates value estimates on every visit to a state in an episode

### 1.2 Mathematical Formulation

The Monte Carlo update rule for value estimation is:

\[V(s_t) \leftarrow V(s_t) + \alpha[G_t - V(s_t)]\]

where:
- \(V(s_t)\) is the value estimate for state \(s_t\)
- \(\alpha\) is the learning rate
- \(G_t\) is the return from time step t to the end of the episode
- \(G_t = \sum_{k=t}^{T} \gamma^{k-t} r_k\)

## 4. Advanced Topics

### 4.1 Importance Sampling

Importance sampling is a technique used in off-policy Monte Carlo methods to correct for the difference between behavior and target policies. The importance sampling ratio is calculated as:

\[\rho_t = \prod_{k=t}^{T} \frac{\pi(A_k|S_k)}{b(A_k|S_k)}\]

where:
- \(\pi\) is the target policy
- \(b\) is the behavior policy
- \(A_k\) is the action at time step k
- \(S_k\) is the state at time step k

### 4.2 Weighted Importance Sampling

Weighted importance sampling is a variant that reduces variance by normalizing the importance sampling ratios:

\[V(s) = \frac{\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}(s)} \rho_t G_t}{\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}(s)} \rho_t}\]

where:
- \(\mathcal{T}(s)\) is the set of time steps where state s was visited
- \(\rho_t\) is the importance sampling ratio
- \(G_t\) is the return from time step t

    def add_episode(self, episode: List[Tuple]):
        """

        Returns:

                state, action, reward = episode[t]
